===========

Simple minesweeper puzzle made with AngularJS.

Take a look at the [demo](http://rawgit.com/gmessalem/minesweeper/master/app/index.html) and have fun ;-)

instructions:

    uncover all of the puzzle tiles to win. hit a mine and you lose.

    * mouse click                      uncover a tile.
    * mouse right-click + shift-key    uncover all of the neighboring tiles (not exposing the flagged tiles).
    * mouse right-click                toggle tile marking (no marking -> flag for bomb -> questionable).

    note: to change puzzle size / amount of mines - change the numbers accordingly.
